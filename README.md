Project Description:

This project humorously tracks your procrastination levels, helping you see just how much you‚Äôre putting things off. It‚Äôs a lighthearted way to recognize‚Äîand maybe even celebrate‚Äîyour procrastination habits without any pressure to change!

 

The Problem (that doesn't exist):

This project "solves" the age-old problem of avoiding productivity! It tracks and ranks your procrastination habits, adding a touch of humor to those unproductive moments.

 

The Solution (that nobody asked for):

We‚Äôve created a playful procrastination tracker that ranks your most creative ways to avoid work. By turning procrastination into a point-scoring game, you can proudly log every distraction‚Äîfrom ‚Äúextreme desk organizing‚Äù to ‚Äúurgent cat video research‚Äù‚Äîand see how your stalling skills stack up!

 

Technical Details:

Our procrastination tracker is built using a sleek web interface that captures and categorizes your procrastination activities. Utilizing JavaScript for interactive features, we log each distraction and assign points based on creativity and time spent. The backend stores user data securely, while a colorful dashboard visualizes your procrastination trends and ranks. Designed for both desktop and mobile, it ensures a fun experience as you track your procrastination prowess!
